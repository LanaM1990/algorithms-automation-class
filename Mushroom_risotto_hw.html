    <h2 class="h2header3">Instructions:</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Heat oil and sauté shallots. Add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to a large skillet or frying pan and bring to medium-high heat, add ¼ cup of shallots and cook until translucent (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
           <li>Toast risotto rice and mushrooms.</li>
           <li>Add 1 cup of Arborio rice & 1 cup of mushrooms and stir to coat rice and mushrooms with oil.</li>
           <li>Add and cook off wine.</li>
           <li>Increase heat to high and add ¼ cup of white wine.  Let rice and mushrooms absorb the wine while the wine cooks off (2-4 minutes). Reduce heat back to med high.</li>
           <li>Add stock to the rice and cook.</li>
           <li>Add about half (2 cups) of the chicken stock.  As the rice absorbs the stock, continue to add stock gradually. Stir constantly. *Preferably, your chicken stock is in a saucepan and warm for best results and a shorter cooking time.</li>
           <li>Continue cooking.</li>
           <li>Continue cooking until the rice is almost all the way cooked through, it should be al denté with a firm center (approx. 15-20 min).</li>
           <li>Add butter and parmesan to finish. When your rice is cooked, reduce the heat to low. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and stir, then gently stir in the ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese reserving some for topping the risotto when serving.</li>

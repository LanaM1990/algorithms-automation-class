# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean. The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]
#

# find arithmetical mean  = sum of num in the list divided by length
# return list with elements below arithmetical mean

    new_list = []

    for num in range(0, len(original_list)):
        sum_num = sum_num + original_list[num] #arithmetical mean sum(original_list)/len(original_list)

    print(arith_m)
    for num in range(0, len(original_list)):

How to make mushroom risotto by Gordon Ramsey

Ingredients:

Arborio Rice - 1 cup of Arborio rice. This is the ideal rice for making any kind of risotto! Shallots - ¼ cup of finely diced shallots.
Olive Oil - 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
Butter - 2 tablespoons of butter (preferably unsalted).
Parmesan Cheese - ¼ cup of shredded Parmesan Cheese.
White Wine - ¼ cup of white wine. I used pinot grigio.
Chicken Stock - 4 cups of chicken stock (have more on hand, you may need a bit more).
Mushrooms - 1 cup of baby Bella mushrooms, sliced.
Parsley - 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley.

Instructions:

Heat oil and sauté shallots. Add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to a large skillet or frying pan and bring to medium-high heat, add ¼ cup of shallots and cook until translucent (about 2-3 minutes).
Toast risotto rice and mushrooms.
Add 1 cup of Arborio rice & 1 cup of mushrooms and stir to coat rice and mushrooms with oil.
Add and cook off wine.
Increase heat to high and add ¼ cup of white wine.  Let rice and mushrooms absorb the wine while the wine cooks off (2-4 minutes). Reduce heat back to med high.
Add stock to the rice and cook.
Add about half (2 cups) of the chicken stock.  As the rice absorbs the stock, continue to add stock gradually. Stir constantly. *Preferably, your chicken stock is in a saucepan and warm for best results and a shorter cooking time.
Continue cooking.
Continue cooking until the rice is almost all the way cooked through, it should be al denté with a firm center (approx. 15-20 min).
Add butter and parmesan to finish. When your rice is cooked, reduce the heat to low. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and stir, then gently stir in the ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese reserving some for topping the risotto when serving.
